# MinesweeperSolver


The aims of this project are:

1) Build a user-friendly minesweeper game in python.
2) Develop functions capable of making all definitely safe minesweeper moves automatically.
3) Develop a function to calculate the probability that each unclicked square contains a mine.
4) Train a neural network to make guesses most likely to result in winning, when no so option is available
5) Determine the highest proportion of minesweeper games that it is possible to win in principle

For a full explanation of the project, the solver that has been built, and plans for future development, see the Minesweeper_solver_development_notebook.ipynb.

To see the solver in action either run the code cell in the development notebook or run User version 20_08_06.py.

Dependencies for this Python code are the Numpy, Scipy, and Pygame libraries.
